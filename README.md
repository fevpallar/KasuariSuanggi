<i><b>*Under construction......</b></i>

This is the 5th & the final of _Kasuari_ mobile _time-killer_ series.

Intro.,

**_Suanggi_** is a _mythical spirit_ or _supernatural_ that appears in the cultural folklore of majority of _Papuan_ tribes accross the _New guinea_ island. Beliefs about _suanggi_ varies through _Papuan_ ethnic groups. According to the folklore, during the past traditional tribal wars, _suanggi_(s) were deployed to watch/spot a particular target (usually the leader/captain) of opposition/enemy side. The intention is to do various acts such as, _spying_, _positional acquistion_  & _navigation_.

Nonetheless, this system **has nothing to do with** _spirits/ghosts, sorcery, or any supernatural_. But it might work (well, about partially) such. What it is intended to do, is to utilize some _vision/motions/movement_ processing to acquire some outputs. It's a sensing through vision.

How is it be useful anyway? I have no idea for now, or like what to gain. There has to be such important output extracted from real world events. As ambitious as it sounds, there has to be nothing wrong things called a side project, right!?. Beside it's a _free-time_ thing afterall. I don't really have particular obligation to finish it anyway.
